// This particular implementation of this intrinsic uses the `paciasp`
// instruction rather than the actual `pacia` instruction, even if that makes
// the implementation more complex due to the required register shuffling. The
// reason here is that `paciasp` is encoded in a space that was previously a
// `nop`, meaning that it is backward compatible to devices without PAC support.
// This isn't the case for the more generic `pacia` instruction.
